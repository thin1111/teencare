        <p id="InOrderToPreventParagraphMotivation">Recently, because parents are becoming busier, there are times when they are unable to give attention to their children. They often get so absorbed in their work, using their valuable time to earn money, that they cannot spend time with their children. Children enjoy spending time with their parents, playing and going places together. Although children want to live happily with their parents, they often suppress their desires when they observe the pressures and struggles of their parents. At first, this may not be an issue, but as time passes, the lack of connection with their parents can lead to feelings of isolation and affect their mental health. Therefore, parents should spend time with their children and create happy memories.</p>

                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">Most teenagers have strict rules and schedules which leaves such little room to explore.</p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">It's important to give them some space, so they become more motivated to work harder and more efficiently in their tasks.</p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">Giving them enough freedom can increase their autonomy, making them realise that whatever decision they make with action has consequences as a result. This makes them have a greater sense of control over their lives.</p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">It also boosts your teenager's confidence in achieving any tasks, creation or activity that they are ideal in, as giving them space strengthens their confidence in their decision-making abilities.</p>

                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">Instead of dismissing their problem or immediately providing them with a solution, listen to them more and let them speak. This creates a sense of realisation from your teenager that you're paying attention to them.</p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">This kind of active listening makes your teenager confront more about their problems to you and overall increasing their respect towards you. </p>

                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">Hobbies are mostly driven by intrinsic motivation which means teenagers participates in them because they enjoy the activity itself.

                            <p>First and foremost, the primary teachers of children are their parents. Before children even go to school, it is their parents who teach them how to speak, walk, and other fundamental skills. Additionally, the heroes or role models for children are often their parents. Therefore, parents should avoid displaying rough behaviors, using harsh language, or engaging in harmful activities like drinking or drug use in front of their children. Children, who are quick to learn from observation, may think that if their parents behave in these ways, they can do the same. So, if you want your children to become the best they can be, you must avoid such behaviors yourself.</p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">In order for your teen to get motivation in studying. You must give them a good example first.</p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">Take a moment to think about yourself. Do you always clean your room or finish your tasks in time?</p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">This is crucial as teenagers tend to replicate their parents' actions.</p> 
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">I'm not suggesting you to be perfect. However, teenagers watch their parents closely and model their behaviour after them.</p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">Even if it means you have to go down the same path, try to complete short tasks that you could finish within a few minutes such as doing the laundry. Overtime, this makes your teenager replicate you and he/she will have a high tendency to finish their tasks quickly. </p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">Embrace new challenges even if it's sounds scary. This also boost your teenager's confidence in replicating you as the believe they could do it also.</p>

                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">Every mistake has consequences which your teen needs to accept and learn from it. Only from then, they'll know what to do when this happens and what not to do when something happens.</p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">For example, if your teen doesn't clean their room, they'll be living in a room filled with trash and difficult to walk around.</p>
                            <p class="TipsOneMotivationContentParagraph">Even if your teen fails an exam, resist the urge to make them retake the exam and let them modify their consequences instead. This promotes their motivation to study more efficiently.</p>

Rewards can make them behave only to get a reward, not because they understand it's the right thing to do. <br> <br> Instead, it‚Äôs better to understand the child‚Äôs feelings and give positive feedback. This helps kids make better choices and learn responsibility.</p>
