                        When I was 14 or 15 years old, I had a lot of small problems at home. I was always frustrated because of my home. As a young person, I wanted to be free and happy, but my family didn‚Äôt allow me. I wanted to go out with my friends, but they didn‚Äôt let me, and I was also afraid to ask for permission. They thought I would get a boyfriend. Unfortunately, my friends had boyfriends. My family was afraid that I might get a boyfriend because of them. But being around people who have boyfriends doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get a boyfriend too. It‚Äôs a matter of self-discipline. Nothing happens without your own decision.
                        <br>There is one thing I kept wondering without asking. It‚Äôs about my guardians because they grew up from childhood. They have experienced the free taste of youth, happiness, and the ups and downs of emotions. Why do they want to control the youth? If their youth was not as happy as they thought it would be, shouldn‚Äôt they be sympathetic? Shouldn‚Äôt they allow us to enjoy life without being traumatized so that we don‚Äôt end up like them? Don‚Äôt you think they should give us that freedom?
                        <br>Unfortunately, my house is very disciplined and conservative. That is why my life has become happier üòÜ . Home is a place that gives you unforgettable memories and happiness, but it also leaves you with traumas that stay in your mind and cannot be forgotten for the rest of your life. I got trauma. Since I was young, they didn‚Äôt understand whatever I did. As a child, I wanted to be loved, but it didn‚Äôt happen the way I thought it would. People loved others more than they loved me. Even when others spoke harshly, some were still smiling and happy. But when I spoke the same way, they scolded me and even hit me.
                        <br>I don't know if it's because I'm a girl , but they don't give me priority at home. I'm the youngest in my family , but I feel like they don't loved me. I always get scolded , whether I do the right things or not. If I do something wrong or right , my family blames me . They say things like , " Because of you. You are an alien. Your mother is like this because of you. Your mother felt when she was pregnant with you. Your father ended up like this because of you. Our sisters are fighting because of you.
                        <br>I was subjected to body shaming .People would say things like, " Your legs are big ," or ask "How are your eyes? Your eyes are small." I experienced this kind of body shaming . At that time , I was just a teenager, and my mood was fluctuating . It was a time when I cared a lot about what others said, so I felt deeply hurt. I ended up crying . I even tried to kill myself. It wasn't just because of the body shaming . The restrictions and constant blame also pushed me to make that decision.
                        <br> When I got older, at the age I am now, the trauma is still there, and I'm afraid to do anything. Since I used to get scolded no matter what I did, now I'm scared to do anything. I feel like I can't make my own decisions anymore. Do people get mad at me when I'm doing something, and they tell me I'm doing it wrong? I feel like they don't like me anymore. 
                        <br>That's why , one thing I want to say is: don‚Äôt scold children. Don‚Äôt hit them. Even if there is a need to reprimand them, explain it carefully and patiently . What you said may be just one word, but that one word could hurt the other person‚Äôs feelings. In addition to causing trauma, it could even lead to the other person‚Äôs death. If you think being a teenager is easy, you are wrong. If you think raising teenagers is easy, you are wrong. Raising them is like entering a competition. A single wrong approach to care can change that child's life. Therefore, I would like to urge you to take good care of teenagers and nurture them properly.
                        <br>That's why , we created this kind of website to prevent others from becoming like me.
